Mediaserver
===========

##What is this?

Here are a series of scripts I'm working on to automate the build of my home server.  They are designed to run on a debian jessie installation, but will probably work on other versions of Debian.  With a bit of time, I'll try and customise and test them on some other Linux platforms.

##Docker

Each of the applications here is built using docker.  For more information, check out the Docker [homepage](https://www.docker.com/).

##Prerequisites

There's some stuff that probably needs to be installed before these scripts will work.  I'll add that information as it comes to me.
