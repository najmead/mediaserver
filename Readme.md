Mediaserver
===========

##What is this?

Here are a series of scripts I'm working on to automate the build of my home server.  They are designed to run on a debian jessie installation, but will probably work on other versions of Debian.  With a bit of time, I'll try and customise and test them on some other Linux platforms.

The following services are in progress, or mostly completed;

#### Content Finders
- Sickbeard 	--> 9000
- NZBDrone	--> 9001
- Couchpotato	--> 9002
- Headphones	--> 9003
- Mylar		--> 9004

#### Downloaders
- SABnzbd+	--> 8000
- NZBGet	--> 8001
- Deluge	--> 8002
- Transmission	--> 8003

#### Managers
- HTPC Manager	--> 9000
- Maraschino	--> 9001

#### Content Servers
- Subsonic

##Docker

Each of the applications here is built using docker.  For more information, check out the Docker [homepage](https://www.docker.com/).

##Prerequisites

There's some stuff that probably needs to be installed before these scripts will work.  I'll add that information as it comes to me.
