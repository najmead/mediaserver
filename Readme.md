Mediaserver
===========

##What is this?

Here are a series of scripts I'm working on to automate the build of my home server.  They are designed to run on a debian jessie installation, but will probably work on other versions of Debian.  With a bit of time, I'll try and customise and test them on some other Linux platforms.

The following services are in progress, or mostly completed;

#### Content Finders
- Sickbeard (Port 9000) [Complete]
- Sonarr / NzbDrone (Port 9001) [Complete]
- Couchpotato (Port 9002) [Complete]
- Headphones (Port 9003) [Complete]
- Mylar (Port 9004) [Complete]

#### Downloaders
- SABnzbd+ (Port 8000) [Complete]
- NZBGet (Port 8001) [To be done]
- Deluge (Port 8002) [To be done]
- Transmission (Port 8003) [To be done]

#### Managers
- HTPC Manager (Port 7000) [Complete]
- Maraschino (Port 7001) [To be done]

#### Content Servers
- Subsonic (Port ????) [To be done]

##Docker

Each of the applications here is built using docker.  For more information, check out the Docker [homepage](https://www.docker.com/).

##Prerequisites

There's some stuff that probably needs to be installed before these scripts will work.  I'll add that information as it comes to me.
